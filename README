First because it is only a minor change:

-   dash based on existing_ `APKBUILD` but with `libedit` support enabled

Then a simple C based program:

-   `jpeginfo <https://github.com/tjko/jpeginfo>`__

Then a library with dependencies that is needed for creating PDFs from scans:

-   `jbig2enc <https://github.com/agl/jbig2enc>`__

Then Python libraries

-   `grpcio <https://grpc.io/>`__ as a prerequisite for google-cloud

-   `google-cloud
    <https://googlecloudplatform.github.io/google-cloud-python/>`__
